"The length of a string can be constrained using the ``minLength`` and "

"The ``pattern`` keyword is used to restrict a string to a particular regular"
" expression.  The regular expression syntax is the one defined in JavaScript"
" (`ECMA 262 <http://www.ecma-"
"international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm>`__ specifically).  "
"See `regular-expressions` for more information."

#: ../../source/reference/string.rst:76
msgid ""
"When defining the regular expressions, it's important to note that the "
"string is considered valid if the expression matches anywhere within the "
"string.  For example, the regular expression ``\"p\"`` will match any string"
" with a ``p`` in it, such as ``\"apple\"`` not just a string that is simply "
"``\"p\"``.  Therefore, it is usually less confusing, as a matter of course, "
"to surround the regular expression in ``^...$``, for example, ``\"^p$\"``, "
"unless there is a good reason not to do so."

"The ``format`` keyword allows for basic semantic validation on certain kinds"
" of string values that are commonly used.  This allows values to be "
"constrained beyond what the other tools in JSON Schema, including `regular-"
"expressions` can do."

"There is a bias toward networking-related formats in the JSON Schema "
"specification, most likely due to its heritage in web technologies. However,"
" custom formats may also be used, as long as the parties exchanging the JSON"
" documents also exchange information about the custom format types.  A JSON "
"Schema validator will ignore any format type that it does not understand."
