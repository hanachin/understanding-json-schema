"The names of the basic types in JavaScript and JSON can be confusing when "
"coming from another dynamic language.  I'm a Python programmer by day, so "
"I've notated here when the names for things are different from what they are"
" in Python, and any other Python-specific advice for using JSON and JSON "
"Schema.  I'm by no means trying to create a Python bias to this book, but it"
" is what I know, so I've started there. In the long run, I hope this book "
"will be useful to programmers of all stripes, so if you're interested in "
"translating the Python references into Algol-68 or any other language you "
"may know, pull requests are welcome!"

"There are many examples throughout this book, and they all follow the same "
"format.  At the beginning of each example is a short JSON schema, "
"illustrating a particular principle, followed by short JSON snippets that "
"are either valid or invalid against that schema.  Valid examples are in "
"green, with a checkmark.  Invalid examples are in red, with a cross.  Often "
"there are comments in between to explain why something is or isn't valid."
