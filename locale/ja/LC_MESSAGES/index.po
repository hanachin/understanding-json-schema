"JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON data.  "
"However, learning to use it by reading its specification is like learning to"
" drive a car by looking at its blueprints.  You don't need to know how an "
"internal combustion engine fits together if all you want to do is pick up "
"the groceries.  This book, therefore, aims to be the friendly driving "
"instructor for JSON Schema.  It's for those that want to write it and "
"understand it, but maybe aren't interested in building their own car---er, "
"writing their own JSON Schema validator---just yet."
